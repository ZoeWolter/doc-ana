        The AskWomen and AskMen subreddits serve as virtual spaces where individuals share their thoughts, seek advice and engage in conversations. 
        <br><br>
        By analyzing the topics discussed within these communities, we can explore how gender influences the subjects of interest and the nature of interactions.
        <br>
        Thus, the goal of this project is to uncover shared topics of interest, unique concerns and potential areas of convergence between male and female perspectives.

      <h3>Data & Preprocessing</h3>
    </div>
  </fieldset>
  <fieldset>
    <div>
      <p>
        From the whole reddit dataset, we started to filter the data to get online the posts written in the AskMen and AskWomen subreddits.
        In total we got 14538 posts in the AskMen and 9278 posts in the AskWomen community. 
        This inbalance suggests that the AskMen community is more popular and more frequently used.
        This also rose the question if there are significantly other differences between the communities apart from the contents discussed.
        One thing we looked at it the average post length in both subreddits. 
        While the average post length for AskMen posts is 257, the avergae post in the AskWomen community is 250 - so there seems to be no huge difference.
        ...
        <br>
        Prior to conducting the analysis, we applied several ><strong>preprocessing</strong> steps to the raw data obtained from the AskMen and AskWomen subreddits.
        Firstly, all the text was converted to lowercase to achieve case insensitivity. 
        To account for negation short forms, such as "can't" or "won't,"  we removed apostrophes from the posts. 
        Next, we removed special characters to filter out any non-essential symbols or punctuation marks.
        Stopwords, which are commonly used but carry little semantic meaning, were removed from the text as well. 
        Finally, we applied lemmatization to reduce words to their base form, ensuring that words with similar meanings are treated equally.
        By implementing these preprocessing steps, the raw text data from the AskMen and AskWomen subreddits were transformed into a standardized and cleaner format, laying the foundation for the subsequent topic analysis.
        The preprocessed data was also used to create the wordclouds displayed above.

      <h3>Topic Analysis using BERTopic</h3>

        add description of BERTopic


        - merge of datasets to get shared topics -> 23816 posts as input data to BERTopic

        - definition of topic, what is topic name

        - outlier topic -1 (13490 posts in total) -> exluded from further analysis !! 56.6% of data in topic class -1

      <p>
        For a first analysis of the topics and whether they are more likely to be discussed in the 'AskMen' or 
        'AskWomen' subreddit, the following plot shows the ten topics with the most posts in both subreddits and 
        their occurence in them. You can see that there are actually topics that are more likely to be discussed 
        in 'AskMen' such as <i>'living_career_live_debt'</i>, whereas others are more likely to be addressed in 'AskWomen'
        as for instance <i>'hair_balding_shampoo_bald'</i>.

        <strong>Topic embeddings:</strong>
        <br>
        From the BERTopic model, we extracted high dimensional embeddings, capturing the semantic information and meaning of each topic. 
        To be able to effectively visualize the topics, we aimed to obtain a two-dimensional representation of the topic embeddings.
        In doing so, we applied <strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong>, a dimensionality reduction technique that aims to capture the maximum amount of variation present in the data, while projecting them onto a lower-dimensional space. 
        This allows for a more concise representation approximately respresenting the underlying topic structure and preserving key patterns and relationships between topics.
        Consequently, topics that are semantically similar or closely related should be positioned closer together in the 2D space, while those that are dissimilar should be placed farther apart. 
        This arrangement allows to identify clusters, patterns, and even potential topic hierarchies within the dataset.
        <br>
        BERTopic itself does also perform dimensionality reduction on the embeddings to produce some in-build visualizations but unfortunately, the model does not provide an option to output the embeddings directly in a lower dimensionality.
        <br>
        An alternative idea was also to calculate the topic embeddings using static word embeddings extracted from the Glove 200 embeddings trained on a large corpus of twitter data. 
        More specifically, one could get a word embedding for each word (that is not out of vocabulary) in a topic's name and then take the mean of the word embeddings as overall topic embeddings.
        Taking the mean should work quite well in this scenario since the words constituting a topic's name should be close together in the embedding space.
        We actually tried this approach as well and the results were quite similar to those obtained above but as we expect the embeddings coming from BERTopic to be more precise, we decided to stick with this procedure.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Design decisions:</strong>
        <br>
        We decided to represent each topic by a circle varying in size and color. The <strong>position</strong> of each cirlce is given by the 2D embeddings.
        An alternative to use circles to represent the topics would be to plot the topic names directly. 
        However, with an increasing number of topics to be analyzed, this would result in severe overplotting. This issue is significantly reduced by taking circles instead.
        <br>
        The <strong>size</strong> of each circle corresponds to the overall occurrence of the respective topic in the dataset. 
        Larger circles indicate topics that appear more frequently, while smaller circles represented less common topics. 
        This size-based representation offers an intuitive overview of the importance and prevalence of each topic in the overall dataset. 
        To ensure that each topic is visible in the visualization, we ordered the topics accordingly and draw small circles on top of larger ones.
        <br>
        We used the <strong>color</strong> of the circles to analyze the distribution of topics across the subreddits.
        Topics predominantly discussed in the AskMen subreddit are represented by blue circles, while topics more commonly found in AskWomen posts are depicted with red circles. 
        Topics with a similar level of occurrence in both subreddits are mapped to a grey color. 
        This color-sceme offers an immediate visual cue to the relative prevalence of a topic in each subreddit. 
        By examining the distribution of blue and red, one can quickly identify topics that are more popular or relevant to one gender-specific community compared to the other. 
        <br>
        In order to identify each topic, we added a tooltip, displaying the most relevant information about each topic. 
        This includes the topics name, its id, the top 10 occuring words, the occurence of the topic as absolute number and the respective percentage for AskMen and AskWomen occurences.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Adjustment for inbalance in dataset:</strong>
        <br>
        To calculate the occurence of each topic relative to the AskMen and AskWomen subreddits, we needed to take the inbalance of our dataset into account.
        Using the absolute number of posts within a topic for AskMen and AskWomen (topic_count_men, topic_count_women) and having 14538 posts in total in AskMen and 9278 in AskWomen, the topic share for each subreddit is given by:
        <br>
        <code>topic_share_men = (topic_count_men / 14538) / (topic_count_men / 14538 + topic_count_women / 9278)</code>
        <br>
        <code>topic_share_women = (topic_count_women / 9278) / (topic_count_women / 9278 + topic_count_men / 14538)</code>
        <br>
        Using these formulas, topic_share_men and topic_share_women always add up to 1, such that we can use it as domain for our color scale.
